      <h2>Why Eco Tips Matter</h2>
      <p> When each of us recycles, sorting out plastics, paper, metal, and other materials instead of tossing them all as trash, we actually help slow down climate change and protect natural resources. Recycling saves huge amounts of energy. For example, making aluminum from recycled cans uses about 95 percent less energy than producing it from raw ore, which also means far less greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p> Even though big companies produce a lot of waste, our daily actions still add up. When households commit to recycling and treat waste responsibly, it helps set expectations and builds pressure for larger systemic change.</p>
      <p> A recent study found that people who feel personally responsible and knowledgeable about recycling are significantly more likely to recycle consistently. By recycling, we not only protect the environment, but also help shift norms and support a more sustainable, circular economy.</p>
