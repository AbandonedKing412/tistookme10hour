    <!-- Section 1: The Main Problem -->
  <section> 
    <h2> The Main Problem</h2>
    <p> Climate change impacts our society in many different ways. Drought can harm food production and human health. Flooding can lead to spread of disease, death, and damage ecosystems and infrastructure. Human health issues that result from drought, flooding, and other weather conditions increase the death rate, change food availability, and limit how much a worker can get done, and ultimately the productivity of our economy. </p>
    <p> However, if we sustain our resolve and act now, we can turn the tide, protect lives, food, and our future. Because every year we wait, droughts and floods displace millions, and crop yields shrink. We all have a role: reduce our carbon footprint, switch to renewable energy, plant trees, conserve water, eat more plant-based foods, and support policies that fight climate change. Small daily choices add up, and collective action drives real change. </p>

    <p>Greenpeace Philippines works to protect the environment by pushing for clean energy, safer climate policies, and the reduction of plastic pollution. They have led campaigns demanding accountability from big fossil fuel and plastic-producing companies. They also conducted groundbreaking climate justice investigations and community-based projects that help Filipinos adapt to environmental risks.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="alt-row reverse">
    <p>Climate justice in the Philippines focuses on protecting vulnerable communities who experience the worst effects of climate change even though they contribute the least to the problem. It pushes for holding major polluters accountable for their role in causing environmental damage. It also calls for stronger government action, fair adaptation support, and policies that prioritize the rights, safety, and dignity of Filipinos facing typhoons, rising seas, and other climate impacts.</p>

      <h2>Success Stories & Innovations</h2>

      <p>
        Communities and organizations across the world are proving that sustainable actions can create real changes.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p> Wangari Maathai: The Green Movement Pioneer</p><bold>
          <p> her leadership, the Green Belt Movement has planted over 51 million trees across Kenya. The initiative not only addresses deforestation but also aims to create awareness about sustainable land management and climate change. Maathai’s influence extended beyond Kenya; she became a symbol of grassroots activism and inspired countless individuals to take action for their environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Fossil Fuel Divestment Movement</p>
          <p> Over 700 organizations globally have divested from fossil fuels, refusing to invest in oil, coal or gas companies. Recognizing the role fossil fuels play in raising the earth’s temperature, various banks, universities, governments and faith-based organizations are no longer investing in fossil fuel extraction.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p> Boyan Slat: Ocean Cleanup Innovator</p>
          <p> Slat’s innovative approach involves utilizing natural ocean currents to collect plastic waste efficiently. The first large-scale deployment of his technology occurred in 2019 in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, where millions of tons of plastic waste accumulate. The organization has since expanded its efforts, with pilot projects in various locations around the globe.</p>
